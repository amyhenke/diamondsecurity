		<p class="mb-2.5">Our guards are SIA Accredited and highly trained. We deliver a full range of guarding roles
			including static manned guarding, stewarding and crowd control, guarding patrols, dog patrols, keyholding
			services and more. On site security teams provide 24/7 cover, ensuring you are never left exposed to
			security threats.</p>
		<p class="mb-2.5">Security dogs add another dimension to your perimeter security systems and practices, offering
			a much more visible element to your security detail and therefore a greater deterrent to any criminals.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-2.5">Having a highly trained security dog is an efficient and cost-effective way of providing
			enhanced security solutions in a range of different scenarios. Security guards and their dogs can be
			employed for a one-off event or for a longer-term solution, and are experienced in working with both large
			and small businesses.
